MyPeeple is an Android application that allows users to privately broadcast their location status to family and close friends. Theres no need to constantly call your husband now to check if he has left the office. Currently the app doesnt connect to a backend server and hence the functinality of MyPeeple is currently restricted to being a location based reminder.
